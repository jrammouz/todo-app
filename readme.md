# Todo App

This repository contains a Todo App built using Angular and React. The app allows users to create, edit, delete todos. Todos are stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`, allowing users to access them later. 

Both the Angular and React versions of the app have the same basic features and functionality.

## Demo

You can access the live demo of the Todo App [here](https://todos-pk.netlify.app/).


## Directory Structure

The repository is structured into two directories:
- **Angular**: Contains the Angular version of the Todo App.
- **React**: Contains the React version of the Todo App.

Each directory contains its own implementation of the Todo App using the respective framework.

To run either the Angular or React version of the Todo App, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pankajkhuswaha/todo-app.git`

- For Angular: `cd angular`
- For React: `cd react`

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

4. Run the app:

- For React: `npm start`

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:4200` for the Angular version or `http://localhost:3000` for the React version to view the Todo App.
